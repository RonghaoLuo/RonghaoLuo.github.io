# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
Share your idea, and together weâ€™ll turn it into a fully playable game prototype.

# ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Ronghao Luo. I am currently doing the [Game Development Bootcamp](https://www.circuitstream.com/bootcamp/game-development) online program from [Circuit Stream](https://www.circuitstream.com/) Network. I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. I build playable Unity prototypesâ€”like my procedural platformerâ€”and thrive working with teams to craft engaging games of any genre.

### My Skills
- C/C++ Experience: Simple Algorithms and Data Structures
- Object Oriented Programming 
- Game Development with Unity



# ðŸ›  Projects in Progress
## [Procedural Platformer](https://github.com/RonghaoLuo/2023-Module-01-Intro-to-unity-assignment-main)
"The Jump Guy" is a 2D platformer made in Unity with procedurally generated platforms. Besides, I learned how to do animation in Unity with finite state machine.

## [Simple Top-down 2D Shooter in Unity](https://github.com/RonghaoLuo/Objects)
I incorporated chain-reaction for the explosion of some of the enemies. The enemies were designed to have inheritance between each type.
