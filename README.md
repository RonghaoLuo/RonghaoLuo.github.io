# üëã Hi there
Share your idea, and together we‚Äôll turn it into a fully playable game prototype.

# üöÄ About Me
My name is Ronghao Luo. I am currently doing the [Game Development Bootcamp](https://www.circuitstream.com/bootcamp/game-development) online program from [Circuit Stream](https://www.circuitstream.com/) Network. I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. I build playable Unity prototypes‚Äîlike my procedural platformer‚Äîand thrive working with teams to craft engaging games of any genre.

### My Skills
- C/C++ Experience: Simple Algorithms and Data Structures		-->	solid memory management and performance
- Object Oriented Programming 	-->	maintainable code and good design patterns
- Has Been Doing Collaborative Projects with Friends		-->	Continue to learn new functions from Unity
- Agile Management		-->	I plan my work and task for every frame of time and do frequent tests; I also give feedback to your game design based on how the mechanics will be implemented
- Game Development with Unity		-->	altogether I can transform your game design into a decent prototype with the mechanics that you intended for.




# üõ† Projects in Progress
## [Procedural Platformer](https://github.com/RonghaoLuo/2023-Module-01-Intro-to-unity-assignment-main)
‚ÄúThe Jump Guy‚Äù is a 2D platformer made in Unity with procedurally generated platforms. I learned how to do animation in Unity with finite state machine. 
This was originally an assignment about the animation in Unity for my course, but I expanded it and made the platforms procedurally generated. The goal of the game is to get as much coins as possible without hitting the obstacles. The challenge is that the more time the player spends, the more obstacles get generated on new platforms.

## [Simple Top-down 2D Shooter in Unity](https://github.com/RonghaoLuo/Objects)
This was originally a project the course used to teach about object-oriented programming. The game gives Vampire Survivor, Roguelike experience. The enemies were designed to have inheritance between each type. Furthermore, I built more features on top of it. I incorporated chain-reaction for the explosion of some of the enemies. 

## [3D FPS](https://github.com/RonghaoLuo/Unit_3_FPS_Game)
This is an ongoing project from my course that teaches Player Interactions and Character AI. The game has intention to be a combat required puzzle solving game, like Half Life.
